The purpose of Readme files are so that other people understand the purpose of the code you wrote, as well as any instructions on how to load, setup and run your project. Readme files should contain a project overview briefly describing what the project does. Installation instructions to setup and run the project, images can also be beneficial to add here as well to instruct users on where certain things may be. Any license Information should be added detailin how the project can be used and any credits to those who have contributed to the projects.

First Update:
I have added a new fill called promiseVersion.js, which is an updated version of the callbackVersion.js file. This new file is to practice with promises, then and catch methods.

Second Update:
I have added a new version of Summer Chores using async/await functions to complete tasks.
